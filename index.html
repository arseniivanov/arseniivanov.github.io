        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Arseni Ivanov, a 25-year-old M.Sc in Computer Engineering graduate from Lund University. I am passionate about machine learning, biomimicry between the brain and neural networks, and exploring the intersections of technology and life sciences. In my Masters thesis, I delved into the world of Self-Supervised Learning, which sparked my interest in the paradigm of contrastive learning and its latest developments.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as applying innovative methodologies to Spiking Neural Networks. My programming knowledge and industry experience have equipped me with the skills to plan and execute machine learning projects from start to finish. Currently, I work with 1D PIR signals, exploring and developing ways to differentiate them by the object of cause. This knowledge has potential applications in other fields, such as EEG-signal analysis, and I am eager to continue expanding my expertise in the realm of neuroscience and biomimicry.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not working on projects or deepening my understanding of the latest advancements in my field, I enjoy honing my language skills, with fluency in Swedish, English, and Russian, and basic proficiency in French and Japanese. I am also skilled in a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++, C, MATLAB, Java, and JS.</p>

            <h3>Peer-to-Peer Augmented Reality Chess</h3>
          </a>
          Augmented reality chess written in C++ using OpenCV and Aruco library for plane estimation/camera motion, the frame is then ported as a texture into OpenGL for graphics rendering. The communication between the two players runs one each peers machine as a separate thread using a TCP network socket which decouples it from the graphics rendering.
