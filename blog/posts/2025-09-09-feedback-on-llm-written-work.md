### Feedback on LLM-written work 

As a PhD student who is supervising and correcting student work from various courses, we have together with my colleagues been dealing with LLM-submissions on various tasks and hand-ins. 

There is a lot to write on this from the aspects learning, to how to use LLM tools efficiently as teacher/peers/rubber-ducks, how to structure college courses around the new reality, how to integrate LLMs into the material, but in this blog I want to highlight the issue of **feedback** on any type of work. 

Cognitively - feedback, tests, and corrections are probably the most useful tools for learning. It has been both well-known folklore knowledge, and rigorous studies that shown that being wrong is a fantastic learning tool, when the brain gets surprised, or has to update an existing belief, learning happens rapidly[^2][^3].

However, every test builds upon the premise that you have some sort of information or context of your solution. In order for you to be able to update your world model, you need to make a cognitive effort to construct the incorrect idea, and make the incorrect prediction first with the honest belief that its the correct one.
You can probably see where this is going, using LLMs bypasses this initial stage of constructing your world model. This means any feedback just becomes new information[^1], which is a much weaker learning signal for the brain, similar to reading the material the first time. Your brain is not surprised of being wrong, because it didn't have a prior belief.

This makes LLM-written hand-ins, from code to essays, extremely demotivating for a teacher, and in general pointless for everyone involved. Anything you correct or fix, will not stick for the student, because they don't have agency over their work and the prior guess on their submission. Any correction essentially becomes a 1-on-1 lecture on course material that should already be known. It's a waste of everyone's time, the student just goes through the motions of the task without learning the contents, and the teacher's time gets used writing feedback that cannot be well-integrated which takes time from the other students who will get something out of the feedback.

I want to finish this blog with what I think this means for the future. I think that currently, in the couple-of-years-long time-window before the universities have started making political decisions to enforce changes to the epistemology of courses in various ways to adopt to the new reality, the quality of the education is briefly in the hands of the students to a much much **larger** extent than it ever historically was. The bell-curve of knowledge will briefly be inverted to a bimodal distribution, with some students graduating without knowing anything but prompting, while others will have super-powers instead of a previous average that was enforced by having to pass tests and exams.

Students that have the understanding of how learning works, and the discipline to endure hard feelings of learning when there is a path of **MUCH** less resistance will be able to use the tools efficiently and know more than ever.
